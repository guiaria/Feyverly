# Feverly coding test :

This repo contains 2 folders

1. Client (React Frontend)
2. Backend (NodeJs express)

## Installation

move to each folder (both Client and Backend) and run 
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Then you can open react web application on localhost port 3000
for backend you can use Postman to send request to port 8800

# This installation did not include MySQL installation which require for most of the function
## Also I have revoked the API key used in this repo because I accidently left it in git commit
